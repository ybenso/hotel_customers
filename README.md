# Commercial goal
The goal of this analysis is to increase the revenue of a hotel by delivering three analyses:
1. Client Segmentation: Identify groups of clients based on their hotel booking behavior
2. Client Expenses: Predict hotel service expenses (food, beverage, etc.) based on
booking behavior
3. Client Lodging Preferences: Predict lodging preferences of customers based on
demographic data to build a recommendation system to enhance customer satisfaction.

# Dataset
The dataset describes customer data from a four-star hotel located in Lisbon (Portugal), between 2015 and 2018. It shows 31 variables that identify the 83,590 clients who visited the hotel during this period. It contains personal and behavioral information as well as demographic and geographical information. The authors of the dataset are Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes, and it was published in the journal Data in Brief. (Reference).

# Data Analysis
Clustering methods such as Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering will be considered to segment the customers. Classical regression methods and tree based methods will be used for predicting expenses, and classifiers such as logistic regression will be useful for predicting lodging preferences.
Figures and tables
The analysis will include tables describing the variables of the dataset as well as results of the models trained, in terms of train and test errors. (e.g. histograms, fitting plots, etc.)

# Why we expect the data set and analysis methods to successfully address our goal
The dataset presents a high number of observations at the client level, so training models based on those existing clients would be particularly interesting as it describes real customers.
